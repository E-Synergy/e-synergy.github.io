In my first semester of my second year, we had to uptake the module of Project Management & Design, which we were tasked to design an agricultural solution implementing IoT valve control strategies, to mitigate heat stress in crops. Heat stress is said to disrupt cellular functions of the plants from a biology standpoint, which is unwanted and very much significant when reflected on the yield in large-scale farms.  

By implementing strategies from our lectures in this module, we were required to come up with 3 actual deliverables:  
- Initial & Final Report
- Physical small-scale product
- Presentation on product

I would like to express my utmost gratitude towards my lecturer, Prof. Ker, who assisted us throughout and provided us with some electronics components like an ESP8266, 16x02 LCD Display with I2C Backpack, TP4056 Charging Modules that kickstarted our journey. This single subtle act by Prof. Ker had motivated us into putting more effort into this project. Those moments with Prof. Ker still linger with me today.

I was joined by my coursemates, Joshua, Nicholas, Irrma & Alif on this group assignment. Even though each of us was on a different commitment level, I understand and respect that everyone has their own schedules. Ultimately, I would say I was somewhat satisfied with our overall performance as a group, though there definitely are, many more improvements to be made. Looking back, I am just glad that we all had our own set of learnings and takeaways from this module, I am positive that everyone at least learnt something.

Working on this project was definitely harsh and safe to say, really exposed me into the engineering mindset, for the first time ever on this journey. There were so many unexpected delays to our timeline, all stemming from problems within our design, and building of the product, including but not limited to,
- Frying electronics due to carelessly inflicted power conflicts
- Incompatible dimensions in actual casing due to design inexperience in 3D Modelling
- Intermittent connections during breadboard testing
- Wiring issues due to incorrect soldering
- Messy wiring due to inadequate planning

<h1>Why I did this internship prior?</h1>

Working in Information Technology (IT) department has allowed me to explore a field that I initially wanted to do as my university undergraduate major, but due to certain concerns about the saturating market demands and its generality, I went in another direction. Having not addressed this little desire of mine, upon completing some of the more complex electronic core modules, I figured that I have gained enough confidence in problem-solving and have decided to utilise my one-month long sem break. Throughout this internship, I was provided allowance and had gained some insights on a different field. I hope by doing so, I get to return to my studies, all fresh with new skills and a whole new direction on what to focus on.
